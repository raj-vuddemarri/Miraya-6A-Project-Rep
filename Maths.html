<h2 class="maths">Contributions of Indian Mathematician Brahmagupta </h2><hr>
<p><big>Brahmagupta was a great mathematician and astronomer. His Father's name was 
Jisnugupta. Brahmagupta was born in 598 CE in Bhinmal, a city in Rajasthan. He spent a
major part of his life in Rajasthan. He wrote many books based on mathematics and astronomy,
some of them are:
Durkeamynarda, Khandakhadyaka, Brahmasphutasiddhanta and Cadamakela.<br>
His contributions to mathematics are:<br><br>
<b>1.Properties of Zero & Rules for Arithmetic with Negative/Positive Numbers:-</b><br><br>
According to Brahmagupta, zero is a number that is obtained, when a number is subtracted from
itself. He has given some properties on this topic they are:<br><br>

1.When zero is added to a number or subtracted from a number, the number remains unchanged;
and a number multiplied by zero becomes zero.<br><br>
2.A debt minus zero is a debt, and a fortune minus zero is a fortune.<br><br>

3.Zero minus zero is a zero.<br><br>


4.The product of zero multiplied by a debt or fortune is zero.<br><br>
5.The product of zero multiplied by zero is zero.<br><br>
6.The product or quotient of two fortunes is one fortune.<br><br>
7.The product or quotient of two debts is one fortune.<br><br>
8.The product or quotient of a debt and a fortune is a debt.<br><br>
9.The product or quotient of a fortune and a debt is a debt.<br><br>
(Fortune are the positive numbers and debt are the negative numbers)<br><br><br>
<b>2. Advanced Concepts in Geometry</b><br><br>
Worked extensively on formulas for area and volumes of geometric shapes and technics for 
constructing geometric figures.<br><br>
<b>3.Rules for fractions</b><br><br>
Provided methods for operations with fractions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and 
division.<br><br>
<b>4. Astronomy and Trigonometry</b><br><br>
-- Calculated acurate sine values.<br><br>
-- Developed interpolation methods for calculating intermediate values.<br><br>
-- Refined methods for astronomical observations.<br><br>
<b>5.Legacy</b><br><br>
-- His work influenced subsequent mathematicians in India and the Islamic world.<br><br>
-- His treatment of zero and negative numbers laid the foundation for modern arthimetic and 
algebra.<br><br>
Brahmagupta contributed much more in the field of mathematics. Here, I have explained a 
few of them.<br><br>
