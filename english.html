<h2 class="english">Work and Life of Ila Sachani</h2><hr>
<p>Ila Sachani a young women was born in a farmer's  family in the village of Moti Vavdi,
Bhavnagar, which is in Gujarat. When Ila was born, the doctors told her parents that Ila would 
not be able to use her hands due to a disability. Growing up Ila had 
faced many challenges. She wanted to write, draw and do many other activities using her hands
which she saw other children do. She wondered WHY COULDN'T SHE JOIN THEM??...... <br><br>
Her mother and grandmother who were skilled in the traditional art of Kathiawar embroidery 
were determined to encourage and teach Ila this art using her feet. Slowly and gradually Ila started 
getting better. Just imagine if people using their hands struggle to put a needle in the thread, how 
DIFFICULT would it be to do it by feet.....but Ila soon became a professional at it. With determination she 
learned many forms of embroidery even the ones outside Gujarat, like - Kachhi, Kashmiri, Lucknawi,
and so on.<br><br>
Now embroidery was a way to express herself for Ila. She first made fine designs just for her family, 
but then the people from her village came to know about Ila's work and were amazed. People started 
admiring and loving her art of embroidery and this soon began to spread. After a while, Ila's art
reached the government office in Surat. They were also very impressed by her work and amazing 
story, so they decided to display some pieces of her work in a state exhibition. This was a complete 
new and different experience for Ila and opened new doors. Her talent soon spread across India. Her
talent was no more hidden but she was famous!<br><br>
By such a encouraging response of people Ila participated in more and more exhibitions and was 
given many awards. She became the celebrated artist and the receiver of the President's medal.
Ila's story is an inspiration for all of us, on how a young girl born with physical disabilities 
became famous and admirable.<br><br>
